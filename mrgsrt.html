        <h2>What is Merge Sort?</h2>
        <p>Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by recursively dividing it into smaller
            subarrays, sorting those subarrays, and then merging them back together in the correct order.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How Merge Sort Works</h2>
        <p>1. Divide the unsorted array into n subarrays, each containing one element (a single element is considered
            sorted).</p>
        <p>2. Repeatedly merge subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until there is only one subarray remaining.
            This will be the sorted array.</p>

        <h2>Invention of Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>Merge Sort was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting
            algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of Merge Sort</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.</li>
            <li>It has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).</li>
            <li>It is suitable for sorting large datasets and can be parallelized efficiently.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages of Merge Sort</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It requires additional memory space to store temporary arrays during the merge process.</li>
            <li>It is not an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it uses extra memory proportional to the size of
                the input array.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Time Complexity of Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst). This is because the
            array is divided into halves recursively (log n divisions), and each division requires merging all elements
            (n operations).</p>
